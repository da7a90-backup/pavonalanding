              Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to learn about Firebase's documentation, SDK integration, and API usage. I gained hands-on experience in setting up Firebase projects, managing collections and documents in the database, and handling user authentication flows. It was an enlightening journey that provided me with a solid foundation in using Firebase for future projects, and I look forward to exploring more of its capabilities.

                My food order app is designed to be mobile-friendly, prioritizing a seamless experience for users on their mobile devices. While ensuring mobile responsiveness, the main focus of the app was to create dynamic functionality using Firebase. As I am currently working on multiple projects, I plan to further enhance the responsiveness of the app as soon as possible. This will involve optimizing the user interface to adapt to different screen sizes and improving overall responsiveness for a smooth and enjoyable user experience. Rest assured, I am committed to making continuous improvements to make the app more responsive and user-friendly in the near future.

                Our solution was to allow users to be invited to a layer, where they can
                see othersâ€™ annotations and make their own.

              To implement this feature, I have created a user interface that displays various products along with their details and an "Add to Cart" button. When a user selects a product, the system automatically adds it to the cart without requiring any manual input from the user.
              Behind the scenes, I have implemented the necessary logic to handle the product selection and cart management. This includes updating the cart data, calculating the total price, and ensuring the cart remains synchronized across different pages or sessions
